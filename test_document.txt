AI Multi-Agent Platform Test Document

This is a test document for the AI Multi-Agent Platform. It contains sample information about artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems.

What is a Multi-Agent System?
A multi-agent system (MAS) is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. These agents can work together to solve problems that are beyond the individual capabilities or knowledge of each agent.

Key Features:
1. Distributed Problem Solving: Agents can work on different parts of a complex problem simultaneously.
2. Coordination: Agents communicate and coordinate their actions to achieve common goals.
3. Autonomy: Each agent can make independent decisions based on its knowledge and objectives.
4. Scalability: New agents can be added to the system to handle increased workload.

Applications:
- Robotics and automation
- Supply chain management
- Traffic control systems
- Financial trading systems
- Smart grid management

Benefits of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
RAG combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. This approach allows AI systems to access up-to-date information and provide more accurate, contextual responses.

The AI Multi-Agent Platform demonstrates how different AI agents can work together using RAG technology to provide comprehensive answers to user queries.
